## Overview
Using Android Studio and Java, I've developed this weather app to be able to display the current weather of a location. This includes data such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind, and more. To accomplish this, an API is used from OpenWeatherMap. We send it city and country information that the user inputs, and receive the weather information we need. We then take the data received and display it to the user in a convenient manner. This was developed only for Android.

## Custom Features
- Easy to read UI
- Packed with weather information
- Usage of API to retrieve data
